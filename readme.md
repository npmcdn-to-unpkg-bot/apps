# TheBluneProject
TheBluneproject is a webapp partly inspired by the **Quantified-Self**-Movement and partly by personal concerns about **Data-Security**.

##The Goal
The app focuses on providing simple applications for mundane tasks inside a safe framework. All the occuring data is stored locally or via cloudservices, so that third parties can easily integrate the data into their system. Doing that should also simplify the analysis of the created data.
