# TheBluneProject
TheBluneproject is a webapp partly inspired by the **Quantified self**-Momvement and partly by personal concerns about **data-security**.

##The Goal
The app focuses on providing simple applications or mundane tasks inside a safe framework. All the occuring data is stored locally or via cloudservices, so that third parties can easily integrate the data into their system. Doing that should also simplify the analysis of the created data.
